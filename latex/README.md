%%% Aim of the white paper:
%%%
%%% In my experience, discussion in conference workshops are not documented. So the aim of the white paper, in a short-term goal, is to encourage people in the workshop to collaboratively contribute and edit the project to create a comprehensive and valuable resource that benefits the entire community.  Looking ahead, the long-term goal is to identify an appropriate venue where the white paper can be refined and prepared for submission. If you have any thoughts, suggestions, or questions regarding this process, please do not hesitate to share them.
